	<h2>Current Available Technologies:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Affordable VR headsets such as Google Glass</li>
		<li>Virtual showrooms and 3D visualizers for cars</li>
		<li>Samsung Gear VR</li>
		<li>Video games such as Pokémon Go</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Commercial Uses of Augmented Reality:</h2>
		<p>In the future, there is a lot of potential for augmented and reality. Augmented reality can create virtual environments that simulate tourist attractions or different geographic regions of the world. It can be used for teenagers or kids to simulate games or movies. It can also be used to display how products such as makeup will look without actually owning the product. These changes will revolutionize the commercial world forever.</p>
		<h2>Educational Uses of Augmented Reality:</h2>
		<p>Google recently announced that it is expanding its Expeditions Pioneer Program, which brings virtual reality field trips to classrooms using Google’s cheap, smart phone-based VR viewer, Cardboard. The goal is to expose students to places they wouldn’t be able to see otherwise. The idea for Expeditions came from a hackathon in Google's education department. Given 36 hours to create a tool that would boost student engagement, Jen Holland, then a product manager at Google Apps for Education, drew on existing Google assets — the recently launched Cardboard, some teaching apps in development and a huge archive of 3D maps and photographs. She combined the three to make interactive virtual reality lessons, which she calls "experiences." "It’s a really practical application of VR and a way to use cutting edge tech for schools," says Holland, now the Expeditions product manager. "We’re not just taking old tech and throwing it over the fence. We thought a lot about how this would be helpful." Students can use Cardboard—an inexpensive pair of VR goggles made from a cardboard cutout, magnets, an Android phone and an app—to move through an experience that their teacher controls from a tablet. The Expeditions program has distributed the equipment to classrooms and worked with teachers to figure out lesson plans, but now, Holland says, they’re opening it up, so any teacher with a tablet and access to VR viewers (Cardboard costs about $20) can use it. With lessons loaded on the tablets, teachers and students don’t need to have internet access, which is important for low-resource classrooms.</p>
		<h2>Research Uses for Augmented Reality:</h2>
		<p>As of the year 2016, 67% of researchers are considering adopting augmented reality in the research enterprise. Augmented reality can be used for experimental simulations, improved scientific technology, cloud computing environments, and advances in localization and structural technology. One example of an experimental simulation is simulating user interaction in a room where there's only one person. With augmented reality, you can simulate other users in the room and allow the subject to interact with them. With cloud computing, you can share information with anyone in the world, allowing the spread of more information and open source projects. It will also allow users to retrieve information from anywhere. Advances in localization and structural technology will help advance archetecture and design industries and will enable the development of augmented reality in complex environments such as workplaces.

		<h2>Recreational Uses for Augmented Reality:</h2>
		<p>Augmented reality is used recreationally too. It is used in gaming, simulations, football games, and sightseeing applications. In gaming and simulations, augmented reality is used to simulate virtual environments. In football, it is used to simulate first down markers and the line of scrimmage on the field. One recent example of augmented reality is Pokemon Go, where augmented reality is utilized by using the camera to simulate the capturing of pocket monsters known as Pokemon. </p>
