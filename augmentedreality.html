	<h1>What is Augmented Reality?</h1>
		<p>Augmented reality connects reality to digital images by enhancing our five senses. Augmented reality is a technology that places a computer-generated image on a user's view of reality. Augmented reality transforms the way we see the world and provides several uses in several different fields. However, Augmented Reality can cause some safety concerns to arise because of user distraction.
	<h1>Commercial Uses of Augmented Reality</h1>
		<p>In the future, there is a lot of potential for augmented and reality. Augmented reality can create virtual environments that simulate tourist attractions or different geographic regions of the world. It can be used for teenagers or kids to simulate games or movies. It can also be used to display how products such as makeup will look without actually owning the product. These changes will revolutionize the commercial world forever.</p>

	<h1>Educational Uses of Augmented Reality</h1>
		<p>Augmented Reality is changing the world of education. One app, called Aurasma, allows students to scan an image with their smartphone to view different educational videos. Other apps, such as Daqri and Popar Toys, incorporate several different educational subjects in an engaging way. Teachers can use these apps in the classroom to enhance the students learning experiences and help them understand the topics. Augmented reality offers a level of student interaction and engagement that has never been seen before in the classroom and connects the digital world to the real world, opening a world of opportunities and bringing learning to life.</p>

	<h1>Research Uses for Augmented Reality</h1>
		<p>As of the year 2016, 67% of researchers are considering adopting augmented reality in the research enterprise. Augmented reality can be used for experimental simulations, improved scientific technology, cloud computing environments, and advances in localization and structural technology. One example of an experimental simulation is simulating user interaction in a room where there's only one person. With augmented reality, you can simulate other users in the room and allow the subject to interact with them. With cloud computing, you can share information with anyone in the world, allowing the spread of more information and open source projects. It will also allow users to retrieve information from anywhere. Advances in localization and structural technology will help advance archetecture and design industries and will enable the development of augmented reality in complex environments such as workplaces.</p>
	<h1>Recreational Uses for Augmented Reality</h1>
		<p>Augmented reality is also used extensively recreationally. It is used in gaming, simulations, football games, and sightseeing applications. In gaming and simulations, augmented reality is used to simulate virtual environments. In football, it is used to simulate first down markers and the line of scrimmage on the field. One recent example of augmented reality is Pokémon Go, where augmented reality is utilized by using the device's camera to capture and battle creatures known as Pokémon.</p>
	<h1>Safety Concerns</h1>
		<p>Even though it revolutionizes commerce, education, research, and recreation, Augmented Reality can have several safety concerns. One concern is that AR can cause user distraction and lead users to be oblivious of the world around them, resulting in car accidents and other disastrous events. Another concern is that hackers can breach AR systems, resulting in invasions of privacy and security risks. Lastly, poorly designed AR systems can cause your vision to be impaired.</p>
