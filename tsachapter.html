		Panther Creek boasts of a wonderful TSA chapter. Despite the school being relatively young, PCHS has been successful throughout TSA. PCHS has qualified for nationals in many events such as TSA Nationals for their video game design team. Recently, the PCHS robotics team has also taken the world by storm with their recent regional championship win and being able to qualify for VEX states for the first time in school history. They have also dominated local competitions as well. PCHS is also doing well in animatronics, engineering, biotechnology, and has added a good SciVis program and good computer programming classes.
